\roottitle{Professional Profile}
Trained as a theoretical high energy physicist, I enjoy solving complex problems with innovative ideas. My background in physics provides a solid foundation for quantitative problem solving skills. I have extensive experience in data manipulation, data analysis, building machine learning models, and deploying the product to end users at a large organization.\\

\headedsubsection
{ Data Scientist -  Machine Learning \hspace{3ex} @Mercy Hospital, St. Louis}
{ Feb 2018-Present}
{\bodytext{ I develop machine learning models to drive operational efficiency and create profitability.
\begin{itemize}
\item  Built and deployed machine learning models to predict the Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) for inpatient admissions. Within a year of its deployment, it has already saved more than 7 million dollars in hospital revenue. This project was selected as a finalist (in cost and efficiency category) at Mercy wide innovation conference. 
\item Developed Qlik Sense app to share the predictions from the model with medical coders who are currently using it to audit and review medical coding at Mercy.
\item Built a Natural Language Processing model based on deep learning to predict the diagnosis for inpatient admission from physician notes.
\item Estimated the financial impact of elective surgery cancellations due to COVID-19.
\item Used Natural Language Processing techniques to automate the cancer registry case findings.
%\item Won first ever Mercy hackathon \href {https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6582628165401792512/}{[LINK]}. 
\end{itemize}

{ Graduate Research Assistant \hspace{9ex}@Washington University, St. Louis}
{ Aug 2013-Aug 2017}
{\bodytext{  I worked on several aspects of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) at nonzero temperature and density. My principle achievements included:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Development and implementation of algorithms to find the saddle point of a multi-dimensional function, and perform multi-dimensional integration numerically,  as required to study the phase structure of QCD and liquid-gas system.
	\item Computation of the mass spectrum and correlation functions in lattice models of QCD by numerically diagonalizing matrices of large dimensions.
	\item Perform multi-dimensional integral numerically using Monte Carlo techniques to calculate the rate of neutrino emission from neutron stars. 
	\end{itemize} }}

{ Undergraduate Research Assistant \hspace{3ex} @Brigham Young University}
{ May 2008-Aug 2011}
{\bodytext{ $\bullet$ I successfully constructed and tested a time-of-flight ion spectrometer that was later used in single photon radiation experiment. As part of the testing of the apparatus, I  collected a large set of data from experiments and performed data analysis (primarily Mathematica).\\
		$\bullet$ In making a brief transition to algebraic topology, I quickly learned new ideas and applied it to my research. My main focus was to identify different triangulations and circle packing on the surface of a sphere and use it to investigate the properties of knots with less than nine twist regions.}
